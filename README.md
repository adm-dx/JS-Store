Webstore HTML5 + CSS3 + Vue JS + Node JS

To check how it works you need NodeJS installed in your system. Then follow 3 steps:
* cd <path to project>
* npm install //to install all dependencies
* npm start //to start node express server
  
After that in case of no errors just open localhost:8080 at your browser.

What works:
* You can add or delete some goods at cart
* You can browse catalog
* You can check all beautiful effects of hover

What doesn't work:
* It is not real project with real DB so there are no filters or no differences between woman, man or kids catalog.

What technologies applied:
* This template was pixel perfect converted from PSD to HTML5 and CSS3 code with Avocode
* Catalog, index and cart pages uses Vue components without vue-cli
* All GET, POST, DELETE and UPDATE requests are handled with Node.JS Express framework
